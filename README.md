# WeakSDEapproximation
This repository follows the work done on weak approximation of SDE.

In the notebook "Infinite double well-histograms.ipynb", I look at the simulation of the infinite double well SDE on large time, using different values of the temperature and the time discretisation. 

Noticing weird behaviour for larger time discretisation $\Delta t$ values, I explore the linearised SDE in "Infinite_doublewell_largedt.ipynb" and try to find why I can observe that behaviour. 

In Characterising eta - infinite double well.ipynb, I try to look at the average of a carefully selected observable and look at how it changes with different values of final time, time increment and temperature.
